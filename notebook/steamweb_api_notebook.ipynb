Players can work together to build a thriving farm, share resources, and improve the local community.  As more hands are better than one, players have the option to scale profit margin on produce sold for a more challenging experience.<br><br></li><li><strong>Improve your skills over time. </strong> As you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, you\\'ll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you\\'ll learn new cooking and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by choosing from a variety of professions. <br><br></li><li><strong>Become part of the local community. </strong> With over 30 unique characters living in Stardew Valley, you won\\'t have a problem finding new friends!
